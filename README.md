The **Spotify Clone** is a web-based music player built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It features play, pause, skip, volume control, and a dynamic progress bar for a seamless user experience. Designed with a responsive UI, it utilizes JavaScript’s Audio API for smooth playback, making it a great frontend project. 🚀🎵
